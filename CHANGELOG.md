## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Executable enterprise risk engine with deterministic 0-100 scoring and Standard, Enhanced, High Assurance, and Critical Change mode selection.
- `safe-change assess` command for baseline-aware risk classification, change-budget enforcement, mandatory evidence configuration, and approval gating.
- Machine-readable `enterprisePolicy` configuration with fail-closed constants that reject force-push and destructive-Git enablement.
- Anti-policy-downgrade detection for skipped tests, removed assertions, weakened coverage, `continue-on-error`, disabled security/provenance checks, floating GitHub Action references, and force-push commands.
- Enterprise enforcement documentation and unit coverage for risk boundaries, mode floors, budget dimensions, mandatory gates, and destructive-policy rejection.
- Atomic multi-agent write leases with session ownership, expiration, baseline identity, starting HEAD, and workspace-fingerprint binding.
- Workspace fingerprints covering Git HEAD, branch, hashed remote identity, configuration, rules, lockfiles, policy, canonical skill, agent profile, Node.js version, operating system, and architecture.
- Source-free evidence bundles with baseline, diff, verification, environment, manifest, SHA-256 checksums, and aggregate evidence digest.
- Tamper-evident append-only audit events linked by sequence number, previous digest, payload digest, and event digest.
- Streaming secret-output blocker for GitHub and npm tokens, private keys, cloud access keys, authorization headers, credentialed connection strings, and generic secret assignments.
- Integrity commands: `lease`, `fingerprint`, `evidence`, and `audit verify`.
- Capability-based agent authorization with explicit allow, deny, resource scope, expiration, and default-deny policy.
- Policy Decision Point and Policy Enforcement Point command contract through `safe-change authorize`.
- Expiring multi-party approval requests with distinct approvers, self-approval prevention, operation binding, request digests, and tamper-evident grant chains.
- Command sandbox enforcing executable allowlists, denied arguments, environment-variable allowlists, bounded output, direct process spawning, and fail-closed unsupported network-denial requests.
- Detached Ed25519 policy-root verification with policy digest binding and configuration-level fail-closed enforcement when signatures are mandatory.
- Enforcement commands: `authorize`, `approval request|grant|status`, and `policy verify`.
- AST Semantic Diff Engine with TypeScript/JavaScript and JSON adapters, detecting unary negation inversion, guard removals, test skipping/weakening, catch block error swallowing, and semantic AST mutations.
- Deterministic Replay Subsystem recording execution sessions, environment snapshots, toolchain digests, and verifying zero-drift across 13 distinct drift categories.
- Cryptographic Attestation Framework implementing RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS) and Ed25519 DSSE (Dead Simple Signing Envelope) in-toto attestations over verification evidence.
- OS-Backed Command Sandbox with direct Node.js/npm executable resolution (preventing CVE-2024-27980 and command injection), process tree termination, temporary home isolation, and scrubbed environment allowlists.
- Signed Approval Identity Registry with Ed25519 keypair generation, approver role assignment, expiration, revocation tracking, and cryptographic signature attachment to capability requests.
- Verifiable Execution commands: `semantic-diff`, `replay`, `attest`, `identity`, `approval sign`, and `approval verify`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Enterprise agent skill policy with Standard, High Assurance, and Incident operating modes, microscopic token-level review, fail-closed stop conditions, prompt-injection boundaries, concurrent-drift controls, test-integrity protections, release gates, and a mandatory evidence report.
- Deterministic per-agent skill composition for all 10 supported coding agents, with canonical, profile, and composed SHA-256 metadata recorded in ownership manifests.
- Strict agent profile inventory, composition regression tests, policy schema, and enterprise skill architecture documentation.
- Native binary load and smoke verification script `scripts/verify-built-native.mjs` executing in GitHub Actions.
- Comprehensive verification state matrix tests covering `pass-pass`, `fail-pass`, `pass-fail`, `fail-fail`, timeout permutations, zero checks, and configuration drift.
- Fail-closed rules tests asserting rejection of missing version, unsupported version, and malformed rule objects.
- Bounded tail buffer unit tests verifying strict memory caps on large MCP output streams.
- Version parity verification check mode (`--check`) in `scripts/sync-version.mjs` and dedicated regression test suite.
- Unified release orchestrator workflow `.github/workflows/release.yml` with OIDC provenance, concurrency protection, and manual dry-run dispatch.
- Release metadata and tag validation tool `scripts/validate-release.mjs` and npm credential/version preflight script `scripts/preflight-npm.mjs`.
- Ordered native-first and root-last publication orchestrator `scripts/publish-orchestrator.mjs` with registry visibility polling.
- Enterprise rollout guide, operations runbook, support policy, code of conduct, and repository CODEOWNERS.
- CycloneDX software bill of materials generation in CI and release artifacts.

### Changed
- Skill installation now appends a validated agent-specific profile while preserving byte-for-byte legacy behavior when no profile exists; status checks detect drift in either the canonical policy or profile.
- Hardened production release policy so only pushed SemVer tags can publish; manual dispatch is permanently non-publishing.
- Release publication now uses exact verified tarball files with SHA-256 reporting instead of publishing from a fresh source directory.
- npm preflight now distinguishes full release, safe root recovery, completed release, and unsafe mixed registry states.
- Re-enabled bounded Dependabot pull requests for npm, Cargo, and GitHub Actions ecosystems.
- Explicit `.gitignore` management: `safe-change init` preserves user `.gitignore` by default; updates to `.gitignore` now strictly require the explicit `--update-gitignore` flag.
- Verification status correctness: Resolved false-positive `verified` status on pre-existing check failures (`fail-fail`, `fail-timeout`, `timeout-fail`, `timeout-timeout`); verification state now reports `failed` with diagnostic reason while keeping exit code 0 to maintain regression exit-code contracts.
- Fail-closed rules evaluation on `save`: `safe-change save` validates `rules.json` schema and version (only version 1 is supported); invalid or malformed rules abort baseline creation with exit code 3 (`CONFIG_ERROR`) without leaking absolute filesystem paths.
- Bounded MCP subprocess output: Replaced unbounded array chunk buffering in MCP server with `BoundedTailBuffer`, capping stdout and stderr memory growth during command execution while retaining trailing diagnostic tails.
- Native distribution alignment: Aligned active binary distribution and `optionalDependencies` to the four fully built and tested targets (`linux-x64-gnu`, `win32-x64-msvc`, `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`).
- CI hardening: Pinned `dtolnay/rust-toolchain` to immutable commit SHA `6bed0761d98439e5a578e2877258200ad565ba87` in GitHub Actions and added post-build native module load verification steps.
- Removed private filesystem URI references across documentation.
