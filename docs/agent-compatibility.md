# Agent Compatibility Research (Milestone C Preparation)

This document records factual, evidence-evaluated research into the skill and configuration mechanisms for four target AI coding agents:
1. Antigravity
2. Claude Code
3. Cursor
4. Codex

Research conducted as part of Milestone C preparation. No installer, plugin manifest, marketplace package, or runtime integration is implemented in this phase.

## Evaluation Standards and Verification Rules

To maintain strict evidence quality, all claims in this document are classified using the following rules:

- **Verified**: The exact behavior is explicitly documented by an authoritative official source or reproduced in an official runtime.
- **Partially verified**: Only part of the behavior is officially documented, precedence/reload mechanics are inferred, or documented behavior contains known ambiguities.
- **Not documented**: No authoritative official source confirms the behavior.
- **Runtime verified**: An actual supported agent runtime was executed to test and confirm the behavior.
- **Community observation**: Behavior reported by third-party users or community repositories; not accepted as official behavior.
- **Inferred**: Logical deduction based on standard operating system file semantics or general agent patterns; requires runtime validation.

## 1. Antigravity (Google DeepMind)

- **Overall Verification Status**: Partially verified
  *(Downgraded from Verified: specification source is private to the local runtime environment without a public canonical URL; no automated installation fixture or runtime test has been executed in safe-change.)*
- **Source Environment**: Local runtime environment documentation (Private).
- **Exact Path**:
  - `C:\Users\zakim\.gemini\antigravity-ide\builtin\skills\agy-customizations\SKILL.md`
  - `C:\Users\zakim\.gemini\antigravity-ide\builtin\skills\agy-customizations\docs\skills.md`
  - `C:\Users\zakim\.gemini\antigravity-ide\builtin\skills\agy-customizations\docs\plugins.md`
- **Runtime Version**: Antigravity IDE (Gemini agent environment, built-in skill version 2.0).
- **Reproduction Method**: Open Antigravity IDE and inspect `<appDataDir>\builtin\skills\agy-customizations\SKILL.md` or invoke the built-in skill `agy-customizations`.
- **Source Visibility**: Private local runtime specification (not accessible via public web URL).
- **Access Date**: 2026-09-25.

### Specifications and Evidence

  - *Verified Behavior*: `.agents/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md`.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: Handling of nested Git worktrees or non-standard workspace roots.
- **User/Global Installation Path**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Documentation-verified (local runtime).
  - *Exact Source*: `agy-customizations/SKILL.md`, heading "Customization Discovery and Locations" -> "3. Global Configuration (Machine-Local)".
  - *Quoted Excerpt*: "Path: `~/.gemini/config/` ... Applies to all projects and workspaces run on your machine."

- **Precedence When Project and Global Both Exist**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Documentation-verified (local runtime).
  - *Exact Source*: `agy-customizations/SKILL.md`, heading "Loading Priority and Precedence".
  - *Quoted Excerpt*: "The priority order (from highest to lowest) is: 1. Workspace Project: Hierarchical discovery walking up from the CWD to the repository root. ... 3. Global Discovery: `~/.gemini/config/` ... If there are naming conflicts ... the higher-priority customization overrides the lower-priority one."
  - *Verified Behavior*: Workspace copies (`.agents/skills/`) strictly take precedence over global copies (`~/.gemini/config/skills/`).
  - *Unknown Behavior*: Behavior when identical names exist across legacy aliases (`.agents/` vs `.agent/`).
- **Automatic Loading**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Documentation-verified (local runtime).
  - *Exact Source*: `agy-customizations/SKILL.md`, heading "Progressive Disclosure (Skills and Rules)".

  - *Verified Behavior*: Names and descriptions are indexed into the system prompt; full Markdown body is loaded on-demand.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: Context budget limits when hundreds of skills are installed simultaneously.
- **Reload Behavior**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Inferred / Partially verified.
  - *Exact Source*: `agy-customizations/SKILL.md`.

- **Update Method**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Inferred (file system operation).
  - *Exact Source*: Not explicitly documented as a dedicated CLI update command.
  - *Verified Behavior*: Overwriting files in `.agents/skills/<skill_name>/`.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: Atomic update mechanics and runtime reload synchronization during active turns.
- **Uninstall Method**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Inferred (file system operation).
  - *Exact Source*: Not explicitly documented as a dedicated CLI uninstall command.
  - *Verified Behavior*: Recursive deletion of `.agents/skills/<skill_name>/`.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: Whether agent sessions keep stale in-memory indices after folder deletion until restart.
- **Separate CLI Executable Requirement**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Documentation-verified (skill contract design).
  - *Exact Source*: `skills/safe-change/SKILL.md`, section "Command Reference".
  - *Verified Behavior*: The skill markdown instructs the agent to run `safe-change` in terminal tools; the CLI binary must be installed on PATH.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: PATH detection on non-standard shells or virtual environments.

### Missing Evidence and Remaining Unknowns
1. No public, authoritative web documentation URL is available for external auditor validation.
2. No end-to-end install fixture has been run to verify safe-change installation, execution, and cleanup.
3. Windows junction vs symlink compatibility for global skill directories requires runtime testing.

  - *Verified Behavior*: Project-level `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` overrides or supplements global UI settings.
  - *Unknown Behavior*: No global skill directory precedence exists because global skill directories are not officially documented.
- **Automatic Loading**:
  - *Evidence Type*: Documentation-verified for rules.
  - *Exact Source*: `https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules-for-ai`, heading "Rule Anatomy & Configuration".
  - *Quoted Excerpt*: "Always Apply: The rule is included in every chat session... Apply Intelligently: The AI determines if the rule is relevant based on the description provided."

  - *Unknown Behavior*: None.

### Missing Evidence and Remaining Unknowns
1. Cursor has zero official documentation for standalone `skills/` directories or `SKILL.md`.
2. Content transformation is strictly required to adapt safe-change instructions into a Cursor `.mdc` rule.
3. Global file-based installation is unverified; only project-level `.cursor/rules/` has official documentation.

### Missing Evidence and Remaining Unknowns
1. Dedicated standalone skill directory format (`.codex/skills/`) is not officially documented.
2. Direct integration requires transforming the canonical `SKILL.md` into an embedded section of `AGENTS.md`.
3. Merging into existing `AGENTS.md` files poses collision and formatting risks without an AST-aware Markdown parser.

## 6. Recommendation

### Candidate for first integration: Antigravity

Antigravity is designated as the candidate for the first runtime integration. It is not described as a verified installer target because an actual install fixture and automated runtime execution have not yet been tested in this repository.

#### Why it is a candidate
1. **Canonical `SKILL.md` appears structurally compatible**: The canonical safe-change skill at `skills/safe-change/SKILL.md` contains the exact frontmatter fields (`name`, `description`) and markdown structure specified in Antigravity's customization system.
2. **Project path is known from the available source**: The local runtime specification explicitly defines `.agents/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` as the authoritative project-level discovery path.
3. **Implementation is likely to require no content transformation**: Unlike Cursor (which requires converting to `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`) or Codex (which requires appending to `AGENTS.md`), Antigravity can consume the canonical skill directory directly without template transformation or syntax conversion.

#### Evidence still required before implementation
1. **Runtime verification**: Execution of an automated install test fixture copying `skills/safe-change/` into a temporary `.agents/skills/` directory and confirming agent pickup.
2. **Public documentation corroboration**: Corroborating local specification rules against public documentation or official release notes as they become accessible.
3. **Platform verification**: Testing directory creation and symlink/junction behavior on both Windows and POSIX operating systems.

#### Unknowns
1. **Frontmatter extension tolerance**: Whether Antigravity permits or ignores additional metadata fields in `SKILL.md` beyond `name` and `description`.
2. **Context indexing overhead**: How many total skills can be present in `.agents/skills/` before prompt indexing performance or token limits degrade.
3. **Cache invalidation timing**: Whether mid-session directory creation is immediately recognized on the subsequent turn or requires an IDE window reload.

#### Installation, update, collision, and uninstall behavior still requiring runtime validation
1. **Installation**: Validating directory permissions, directory creation idempotency, and handling when `.agents/` does not yet exist in the repository root.
2. **Update**: Verifying atomic file overwriting when an active agent session may have opened file handles to `SKILL.md`.
3. **Collision**: Validating behavior when `.agents/skills/safe-change/` collides with a pre-existing user-defined skill of the same name, or when global (`~/.gemini/config/skills/safe-change/`) and project skills conflict.
4. **Uninstall**: Validating clean directory removal without leaving orphan subdirectories or causing agent error states on subsequent prompt turns.
